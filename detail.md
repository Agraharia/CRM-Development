## üéØ Project Overview
Developing a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system to streamline the management of **Leads, Contacts, and Opportunities** for enterprise clients.  
The system provides centralized access across **web, mobile, and desktop** platforms via RESTful APIs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionalities
- Developed **MVC modules** for complete CRUD operations on Leads, Contacts, and Opportunities.  
- Designed and consumed **RESTful APIs** to support cross-platform client integrations.  
- Implemented **JWT-based authentication** with role-based authorization (Admin, Manager, Executive).  
- Automated workflows for lead progression with **email and status-triggered actions**.  
- Configured **Redis caching** to improve performance and **Serilog logging** for monitoring.  
- Integrated **Swagger** for API testing and documentation.  
- Currently integrating **SignalR** for real-time notifications and **Hangfire** for background processing.

## üß† Architecture & Design
- Applied **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns.  
- Used **Repository and Unit of Work** patterns for efficient EF Core data access.  
- Developed custom **middleware** for authentication, caching, and global exception handling.  
- Followed **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to support modular expansion and maintainability.

---

## üöÄ Current Status
- **90% of core modules completed** with the API layer tested across web and mobile platforms.  
- **Next Phase:** Azure CI/CD pipeline setup and transition towards a microservices-based structure for scalability and modular deployment.

---

## üèÜ Key Contributions
- Designed and implemented core backend services with robust API layer.  
- Optimized database operations through EF Core and query performance tuning.  
- Collaborated closely with frontend and QA teams to ensure consistent API behavior.  
- Maintained high code quality using SOLID principles and reusable components.
